# A-site for watching anime **Important:** This site is not my original development. I just improved the design and added some new features. The original version was made by [Damasutsu](https://github.com/Damasutsu).

**Startup instructions (for developers):** In the terminal of your program (e.g. VS Code), run the following commands:

1.  **Install dependencies:** Type and execute the 
    ```npm install``` 
    command (press Enter). This command will load all the libraries and packages needed for the project.
2.  **Start development mode:** After the dependencies have been successfully installed, type and execute the
    ```npm run dev``` 
    command (press Enter). This command will start the local development server and you will be able to see the site in your browser.
