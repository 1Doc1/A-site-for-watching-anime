**Important:** This site is not my original creation. I have only improved its design and added some new features. The original version was created by [Damasutsu](https://github.com/Damasutsu).

## Instructions for Running (for developers)

In your program's terminal (for example, VS Code), execute the following commands:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    This command will download all the necessary libraries and packages for the project to work.

2. **Run Development Mode:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    After the dependencies are successfully installed, this command will start a local development server, and you will be able to see the site in your browser.
